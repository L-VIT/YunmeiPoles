                            met first.

                <span>CORROSION DANGER. WE PROTECT OUR PRODUCTS.</span> Forget about corrosion. We have introduced a hot-dipped galvanizing production line, which uses the world’s first-grade galvanizing process and a large-scale zinc pot with zinc holding capacity of 1100 tons. We use 8 sets of dedicated galvanizing high-speed pulse burners, an automatic temperature control system (Japan FUJI), systematic engineering and professional galvanizing furnace design. All of them are customized for the steel tower galvanizing process and characterized by rapid temperature rise, ideal temperature uniformity and excellent heat insulation effects. There’s also an original combustion chamber function - a unique function to protect the zinc pot and promote exhausted combustion during the burner operation. The fully automatic temperature control system and the automatic on/off feature of the burners ensure constant temperature control for the zinc liquid temperature and guarantee the galvanization quality. The hot-dipped-galvanized production line effectively improves the automation and production efficiency, reduces the intensity of labor, improves the hot-dipped galvanizing production environment and reduces environmental pollution, by achieving the purpose of environmental protection, energy conservation and production cost reduction and improving the product quality.

                <span>PROTECTION GOES DEEPER THAN YOU MAY THINK.</span> For structures that are installed below ground, we use a reliable polyurethane spray coating system, which is like an enamel-looking layer of thermoset plastic. It attaches firmly to the steel pole, protecting that part that’s underground.

And in the fifteen years of making steel structures, we have managed to do it in time in 99% of cases. The remaining 1% of delays was mostly related to weather conditions and other factors we had no control over.

                We have the experience of delivering our steel structures via different transportation means: auto, railroad and by sea in a container. Regardless of the method of delivery, we guarantee that your cargo will be safe while it’s being shipped to you. We try and minimize the number of places the product goes, by combining the parts of structures in as few packages as possible. This speeds up the loading and unloading process too. All the small details such as bolts, screws, washers and plates are securely packed in steel barrels to minimize the risk of loss of details upon delivery.
